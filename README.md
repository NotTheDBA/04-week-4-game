# Jedi Battle
## An (unofficial) Star Warsâ„¢ themed battle game

The purpose of this game is to demonstrate a working knowledge of jQuery for program logic and DOM manipulation.  Game characters are created as JavaScript objects, and the game also incorporates some HTML5 elements and custom CSS styling.

Since this is a simple JavaScript app, no installation or setup is necessary.  You can access the demo <a href="https://notthedba.github.io/week-4-game/">here</a>.
